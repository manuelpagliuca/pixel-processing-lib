An old and really simple library made in Java for the course of Multimedia Systems @UNIUPO A.Y. 2019/2020, but i managed to load it on GitHub üåç.

# Description üëæ
Inside the library there is a test class which is runnable and allows you to test different the transformations.

1. Discrete Cosine Transform at 1D
2. Discrete Cosine Transform at 2D
3. Discrete Fourier Transform
4. Testing the JPEG Pipeline overall, this will open up two different windows that will show the pre-image and post-image.

Inside the repository are present some samples inside the folder *samples*. The *JPEG Pipeline* test will use *Sample.jpg* as testing image.
